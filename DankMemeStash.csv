How you look when,you wake up and the charger wasn't plugged in,When you finally realize your winter body, is just your regular body,When you're on a diet,and people keep bringing junk food to work,When you find out you need a 425% on the final, to pass with a C,I didn't choose the thug life,The thug life chose me,,,When people say," ""Harambe was just a gorilla"""
When a day-old meme is already stale ,and you lowkey miss being the center of attention,When someone explains something to you three times ,and you still have no idea what's going on,When you hold the door for someone,and ten people walk through,,,When you retake a class after failing ,but fail it again,,,When you explain something to someone like 27 times,and they still don't get it
,,When you're about as ready for school ,as Mariah Carey was for the new year ,When you thought your meme was edgy, but then it gets removed,,,I am an ocean, of emotion,,,,
,,When you get a 30 on the midterm, and the median was a 28,When someone gets up to hand in their final ,but you're still flipping through the exam trying to find a problem you can actually solve,,,When you were supposed to start your paper at 8pm ,but now it's 2am and all you've done is look at memes,,,,
,,,,,,,,When you try to caffeinate yourself ,but you just end up increasing your heart rate while remaining exhausted,,,,
